# My Food Choices

## Description

Ever been to an event where food was served, and you, or someone you know, had a hard time finding food that they like or that fits their dietary needs?

Well, the solution is **My Food Choices!**

**My Food Choices** is a simple tool for users to store their food favorites, preferences, dislikes and dietary restrictions to share with event organizers for any event where food is served!

It has an interface for users to enter their dietary choices, and another for event organizers/food servers to view the needs of the entire list of guests.

Simply put, whether it is business or personal, this app will help you find the food of your choice!

### Example 1

You work in Human Resources for a mid-size firm and you are organizing an event to honor the best employees of the year in the firm. You are inviting 200 employees to a hall in a hotel and you want to tell the kitchen what to cook. However, amongst the employees are:

1. Cohen: He wants kosher food with low salt for his hypertension.
1. Aaditi: She wants no beef because she's hindhu, but she also does not eat fish.
1. Muhammad: He wants halal food, but he's also diabetic and doesn't like broccoli.
1. Amy: She's vegetarian.
1. 150 guests prefer mashed potatoes over french fries
1. 120 guests prefer pasta over rice.
1. 50 guests are following a keto diet.
1. Only 10 guests like canned juice.

_Well, you get the idea!_

Imagine if all of this info was stored in a database and all you had to do was click a button to send it to the hotel kitchen! The solution: **My Food Choices!** Sweet! Right?

### Example 2

You are a wedding planner and there are 150 guests invited to the wedding. You want to impress the bride and groom, so you want to offer them a tailored menu for the guests. The solution: **My Food Choices!**

You simply send a link with the wedding invitation to each guest. Users can opt to fill out their dietary needs and preferences for the wedding event only, or they can create an account and save their choices to share for any future event with the click of a button.

Are the bride and groom impressed? You betcha!
